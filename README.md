# SUSF-Rover

This version uses a binary tree to hold all values. 
I have no idea whether this is better but binary trees by nature are quite efficient.
The tree also allows efficient searching of data and easy fina and replacement of it.
Additionally since all variable names are stored in the control state modification of keymappings will
be quite easy in a gui and so will being able to get all data from the tree.
